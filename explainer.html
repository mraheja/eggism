    <h1>Physics Documentation</h1>
    
    <p>This page documents the technical model used to simulate hydrostatic equilibrium on non-spherical bodies.</p>


<h2>Gravity Model (Discrete Volume Summation)</h2>
<p>The planet's gravitational field is calculated using a <strong>Stack of 20 internal masses</strong>. These points are
    distributed linearly from the South Pole (<code>-Radius</code>) to the North Pole (<code>+Radius</code>) along the
    planet's primary axis.
    <br><br>
    To ensure accuracy for different planetary shapes, their separation is multiplied by the <strong>Egg Taper</strong>
    factor—shrinking them toward a singular point for spheres and stretching them horizontally matches the asymmetric
    volume as the planet elongates. Each mass slice is dynamically scaled proportional to the local cross-sectional
    volume (M &prop; R<sup>2</sup>).
</p>

<p>This approximates the self-pull of a uniform solid body. For spherical worlds (Taper = 0), these slices analyticaly
    collapse into a single central point mass.</p>

<h3>The Gravity Rod Model</h3>
<p>Because accurate 3D volume integration is mathematically expensive, this simulation uses a <strong>"Needle"
        approximation</strong>. Instead of spreading the mass in all directions (like a solid basketball), we stack it
    strictly along the vertical axis (like a thin rod).</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Needle Physics:</strong> Gravity is concentrated on a single line. This results in extreme attraction at
        the polar tips relative to the equator, creating the "deep bulbs" seen at high taper.</li>
    <li><strong>Solid Planet Reality:</strong> A real egg-shaped world would have mass distributed throughout its 3D
        volume. Its gravity field would be much smoother and more spherical, as the width of the planet would "cushion"
        the pull and connect the polar seas into a global ocean.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Equipotential Logic</h2>
<p>The "sea level" is an <strong>Equipotential Surface</strong>. Water settles precisely where the sum of gravitational
    and centrifugal potentials is equal across common radii.</p>

<p>For highly tapered eggs, expect water to congregation primarily at the deep/fat base but also in a separate bulb at
    the tapered end. This happens because the poles of the planet act like unique centers of attraction, leaving the
    equator of the long egg high and dry.</p>

    <h2>Technical Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Self-Gravity:</strong> The sea level is determined by the solid planet's mass, ignoring the gravitational
            attraction of the water body itself.</li>
        <li><strong>Static Resolution:</strong> Uses fixed 20-pole summation; higher densities required for engineering
            accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Vibrational Equilibrium:</strong> Does not simulate acoustic or tidal waves.</li>
    </ul>
